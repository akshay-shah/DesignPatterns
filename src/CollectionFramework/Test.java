//    In Java we have three main types of interfaces that provide specific solutions:
//
//    Set: collection that doesn’t allow duplicates and also doesn’t allow accessing elements by index. Instead provides methods that check if element or elements exists.
//    EumSet  – specialized class to work with enum types.
//    HashSet – keeps unordered list of elements (order is unpredictable). Implementation based on HashMap.
//    LinkedHashSet – keeps ordered list of elements. Implementation based on LinkedHashMap.
//    TreeSet
//            SortedSet


//    List: is collection that allow duplicates and behave like array (index elements by integer) but is more flexible. First element has index = 0, last one has index = length-1.
//    ArrayList – keeps unordered list of elements using array
//    LinkedList – keeps ordered list of elements using doubly-linked list.
//    Vector – mostly the same as ArrayList but it is thread safe


//    Map: is collection that allow duplicates and is similar to list except that index elements by key (key can be any object) Map can be assumed as associative array.
//    HashMap – keeps unordered list of elements using array
//    LinkedHashMap – keeps ordered list of elements using doubly-linked list.
//    TreeMap – keeps ordered list of elements using RBT. Elements are ordered by natural order or by custom comparator.
//    Hashtable – keeps unordered list of elements as HashMap, but is synchronized. This class is obsolete.
//    EnumMap
//            Properties


//    The are three subtypes of list that are specific and worth notice:
//
//    Stack – Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from top of collection. This principle is called LIFO (Last In, First Out)
//    Queue – Elements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) in order they where added. This principle is called FIFO (First In, First Out)
//    Decque – Elements are added and removed from both sides. (Pronounced “Deck”)
